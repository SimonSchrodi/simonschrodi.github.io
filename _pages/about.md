## Simon's personal academic website
Hi and welcome to my (Simon Schrodi's) personal academic website!

### About me

I am a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Freiburg, working in the area of explainable machine learning advised by [Prof. Thomas Brox](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/brox/). Most of my research focusses on better understand how neural networks work, but I am also broadly interested in many other topics such as automated machine learning, robustness, or machine learning for climate science. You can find some of my works under the Publications page or on [my Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yC-y0PEAAAAJ&hl=en).

### My academic background
I started my academic journey with a BEng in Computer Engineering (1.3, equal to A) at DHBW Karlsruhe as part of a dual study program at [SICK AG](https://www.sick.com/de/en/). At SICK AG, I worked on various deep learning solutions for their sensor systems used in the logistics industry. Afterwards, I did my MSc (_summa cum laude_, 1.0, equal to A) in Computer Science at the University of Freiburg. During my master's studies, I did research on the robustness of optical flow networks and automated machine learning. I also participated in the CVPR 2021 - NAS Competition Track 3, where we won 2nd place.

### Me, personally
When not coding, I like to make music and stay active. I play accordion in a local orchestra and occasionally in project orchestras. I also like playing solo, but more as a hobby. Besides that I like to go running, hiking, and traveling.
